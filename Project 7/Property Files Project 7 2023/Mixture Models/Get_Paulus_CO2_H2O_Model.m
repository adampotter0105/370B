% The general mixture model below is from Lemmon and Jacobsen
% Int. J. of Thermophysics, Vol. 20, p. 825, 1999

% Mixture excess fitting parameters:
Mix_i = [1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 8];
Mix_j = [2 4 -2 1 4 4 4 0 4 -2];
Mix_N = [
    -0.245476271425e-1
    -0.241206117483
    -0.513801950309e-2

    ];

% Note that the last Mix_N coefficient in the array above is different in
% the Paulus and Penoncello paper than in the Lemmon and Jacobsen paper.
% They give it as: 0.269923313540e-5 (a 2 is missing in the third place) as
% opposed to 0.262992331354e-5 in the original mixing model.
